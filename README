So you want to use the logger? You'll need a few libs first.

Local computer libs:
-time
-serial
-requests
-datetime
-os

Server libs:
-bottle

Once that is setup, you need to do a bit of hacking with the Arduino. The Arduino
can interface with numerous dallas temperature sensors. However you need to know
the HEX address of each sensor. You need to run the tempsensor_search function on
the arduino with each sensor plugged in seperately. Open the serial console once 
you load the arduino with the sketch. The first line should have 8 groups with 2 
hexadecimal digits each. Copy/paste or write those digits down and make note if 
this is the temp sensor for 'in' or 'out'. Do the same with the second temp sensor.
Open up TempSensorCode.ino and edit the values around line 20 and 21 to match what
you recorded eariler.

If you have detection problems, make sure the sensor wire is in arduino pin 3.

For the python script, please make sure that you edit server and sample_time which
are around line 30 in the file tempserial.py. Once you do that, you should be able
to monitor your temp on the local output.

Details for the webserver will be in Webserver.README, still todo.
